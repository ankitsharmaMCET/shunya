Here we develop a transportation sector model for India with several sub-sectors or branches:  
* road transport  
  - light duty vehicles (LDV)  
  - medium duty vehicles (MDV)
  - heavy duty vehicles (HDV)  
  - buses   
    + city   
    + inter-city   
* rail transport  
* electric city transport  
  - trams and trolleys  
  - metro and short-distance trains  
* air transport  
  - domestic and international   
* water transport  
  - domestic  
  - international  

All transportation services deliver two types of services: passenger transportation, and freight. 


## Road transport



## Light Duty Vehicles (LDV)  

LDV or cars are modeled to deliver two types of transportation services, based on efficiency/fuel consumption per trip:  
* highway passenger*km (`P-LDV-HWY`)   
* city passenger*km (`P-LDV-CTY`) 


### Commodities
```{r}
GSL <- newCommodity(
  name = "GSL", 
  unit = "PJ", 
  slice = "ANNUAL")
```

### Transport services
```{r}
PLDVHWY <- newCommodity(
  name = "PLDVHWY", 
  desc = "LDV passengers transportation on highway",
  unit = "MPKm", # "million passenger * km", 
  slice = "YDAY")

PLDVCTY <- newCommodity(
  name = "PLDVCTY", 
  desc = "LDV passengers transportation in city",
  unit = "MPKm", # "million passenger * km", 
  slice = "YDAY")
```

### Infrastructure
```{r}
GSTATION <- newCommodity(
  name = "GSTATION", 
  desc = "Gas station",
  unit = "PJ", # number of cars to fuel a year
  slice = "ANNUAL")

CHARGEST <- newCommodity(
  name = "CHARGEST", 
  desc = "Electric car charing station",
  unit = "GWh", # number of cars to fuel a year
  slice = "ANNUAL")

```
